Asych apex
    - future, batchable, queueeuable, schedulable
Future
    - static, SOBJECT CANNOT BE PARAMETER (only primitive datatype allowed), void.
    - @future
    - how many parameters we can pass? (trick question)
        - whatever number of parameters we want to pass.
    - we CANNOT call future method from a future method(directly or indirectly)
        - Department trigger
            - calling future method
                - inserting employee
                    - so, employee trigger executes
                        - inside employee trigger, we are calling another future method.
                            - THIS WILL THROW ERROR.

Interface
    - what? 
        method CANNOT have any body.
    - We just declare method in interface (just method signature).

    We implement interface in another class 
        - class must implement the method declared in interface.

Batch apex:
    - if we want to process huge number of records we use Batch class
    - updating 2000 records at a time.
        - it is giving CPU Time limit error
        - we want to update 5k records. How?
            - use batch apex, group records in 1000 records at a time and process it.
    - how many methods which we MUST implement? and which are those?
        - 3. 
        - start, execute, and finish.
        - which method is called only one time?
            - finish and start.
            - only execute method executes multiple times.

Real time scenario:
    - item custom object
        - 30 records
            -> 100 records
    - all the open item records
        - write a batch to process all the older records. Data migration step while deployment
